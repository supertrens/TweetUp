## This documentation is a work in progress (WIP)
Feel free to update at anytime!!!

This is the Mobile codebase for our "event" app.
The main language is Dart/Flutter. However, we might add some native code ( Java/Kotlin or Swift),
if we need to implement something that is not available yet in Flutter.

## Getting Started

We are trying to ffollow github flow [reference](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).
Please try to keep the master branch as clean as possible. 
That's mean the master branch should always be compatible with production code.
Prior to merge to master, please merge your different features branches to the "devlopment" branch.
And also, after Merge please delete the branch that is merged.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
